  text: string
  options: { label: string, text: string }[]
  correctAnswers: string[]
  explanation?: string
  
  // Categorization & Tagging
  category: string // "Adult Psychiatry", "Child Psychiatry", etc.
  subcategory?: string
  examPart: "Part 1" | "Part 2"
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"
  topics: string[] // ["Depression", "DSM-5", "Pharmacology"]
  
  // PRITE-specific metadata
  examYear?: number
  questionNumber?: number
  
  // Performance tracking
  averageScore?: number
  timesAnswered: number
  weaknessIndicator: boolean // Flagged as commonly missed
}
```

## Phase 2: Intelligent Study System üìö

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- Implement SM-2 or Anki-style algorithm
- Track user performance per question
- Adaptive scheduling based on confidence/accuracy

### Weakness-Focused Study Mode
- Analytics dashboard showing performance by category
- "Study Weaknesses" mode that surfaces low-performing areas
- Customizable study sessions by category/topic combinations

### Study Session Features
- Timer and performance tracking
- Confidence ratings (low/medium/high)
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Progress visualization

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Explanations ü§ñ

### UWorld-Style Explanation Generation

- **Incorrect Options**: 1-2 sentences per wrong choice
- Context about PRITE exam patterns and common pitfalls

### AI Integration Architecture
- Claude API integration for explanation generation
- Caching system for generated explanations
- Manual review/editing capability for accuracy

### Content Quality System
- Community rating/feedback on explanations
- Expert review workflow
- Continuous improvement through user feedback

## Technical Architecture Priorities

### Database Enhancements Needed
- [ ] Expand Question model with tagging/categorization

## Question Upload Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid OCR + AI
1. **Client-side preprocessing** with Tesseract.js
2. **AI post-processing** with Claude Vision API for accuracy
3. **Interactive editing** interface for corrections

   - Category performance tracking

3. **'Study by Frequency' Mode**
   - Smart study sessions focusing on high-frequency topics
   - Weighted question selection based on upload frequency
   - Performance correlation with topic frequency

### Phase 3: Study System Development
1. **Basic Study Session Interface**
   - Timer and performance tracking
   - Question presentation with immediate feedback
   - Session statistics and progress

2. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**

## üìÇ KEY FILE LOCATIONS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### Core Components
- `src/pages/UploadPage.tsx` - Main upload interface with AI processing
- `src/components/QuestionEditor.tsx` - Question editing with full validation
- `server/routers/ai.ts` - Claude Vision API integration
- `server/routers/questions.ts` - Database operations (see `createFromUpload`)

### Database Schema
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Full Question model with PRITE metadata

### Environment Setup
- Claude API key in `.env` as `CLAUDE_API_KEY`
- PostgreSQL database via `DATABASE_URL` 
- Local dev: `npm run dev` (runs both client and server)

## üîÑ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx)
2. **Database Changes**: `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
3. **Deployment**: Push to GitHub ‚Üí Render auto-deploys
4. **Environment**: Development uses fallback mock data when API unavailable
